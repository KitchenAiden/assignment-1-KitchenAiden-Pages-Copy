        <h2 style="color: #ff85b8">Assignment One - Oct. 13:</h2>
        <p style="color: #ff85b8">In this assignment, I had a bit of difficulty setting up my environment, but I added some extensions (Live Preview is amazing), reconfigured my VS Code settings and went on to design and fill out index.html. I had known a little bit about HTML before this assignment through random videos, but I really cemented that knowledge through actually building a something. I am happy that I went through the effort of styling things, as learning about styling was fun. As for resources, the lectures and recordings helped the most, while specific Reddit threads filled in the gaps for me when needed.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #ff85b8">Assignment Two - Oct. 23:</h2>
        <p style="color: #ff85b8">In this assignment, I had quite a few issues with actually applying my CSS knowledge. The largest hurdle for me were definitely some weird poisitioning issues with flex and grid. Eventually, through googling "how to align an element in x container" and similar things, I figured things out. For most other issues, the examples repository helped a ton: paired with Microsoft's Live Preview extension, I was able to fiddle with different lines to see if what I understood was correct as well as how things worked under the hood. I'm exited to go back to this next assignment and fix up some smaller imperfections and readability.</p>
