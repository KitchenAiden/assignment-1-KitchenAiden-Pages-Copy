        <h2 style="color: #ff85b8">Assignment One - Oct. 13:</h2>
        <p style="color: #ff85b8">In this assignment, I had a bit of difficulty setting up my environment, but I added some extensions (Live Preview is amazing), reconfigured my VS Code settings and went on to design and fill out index.html. I had known a little bit about HTML before this assignment through random videos, but I really cemented that knowledge through actually building a something. I am happy that I went through the effort of styling things, as learning about styling was fun. As for resources, the lectures and recordings helped the most, while specific Reddit threads filled in the gaps for me when needed.</p>
