        <h3 style="color: #ff85b8">Previous Experience:</h3>
        <p style="color: #ff85b8">I used dotnet extensively before this class for various things; the most interesting project that I've completed using it is an audiobook generator using GCP's TTS API. Outside of those two, I haven't done any real web development, so my experience is quite limited.</p>
        
        <h3 style="color: #ff85b8">What I Want to Learn:</h3>
        <p style="color: #ff85b8">From this class, I hope to learn how to make a solid website and work with common frameworks. I would like to be able to build up a nice looking website to host links to my projects and maybe document my birding activities.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #ff85b8">Interesting Fact:</h3>
        <p style="color: #ff85b8">As I hinted at before, I recently got into birding. I think that it's a pretty interesting thing about me, as I had never really looked at and appreciated birds until a few months ago. Below, I have an image of my favorite bird, a great blue heron that my girlfriend and I named <em>Martin</em>. We spotted him three days in a row on this river in Pendleton.</p>
